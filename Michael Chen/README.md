# Autoencoder, Custom CNN, and ResNet
This folder contains the models that Michael worked on.  
Instructions for use:  
1. Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells. Put the zip file in the same directory as the dataloader.
2. Run Dataloader.ipynb (or Dataloader_HPC.ipynb if you are on the cluster). This file generates the .csv files for training and testing.
3. Run whichever model's .ipynb you like. This will generate four .png plots and a .pth file containing the best model state. Please ensure that the .csv files are in the same directory as the model's .ipynb.  
  
The documents folder contains the changelog as well as the project presentation and project paper.  
The output folder contains .csv files, .png plots, and .pth files for your reference.
